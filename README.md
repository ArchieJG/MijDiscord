# MijDiscord

My Discord bot library that's partially based on Discordrb. Was made because I found Discordrb to be not satisfactory for my purposes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mij-discord'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install mij-discord
```
